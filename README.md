/reset
Allows you to reset different parts of the server. <br>
Be careful as this can delete Survival worlds forever.<br>
Info: To work properly, the World reset needs a startup script to be set (spigot.yml, settings.restart-script). Otherwise, you have to manually start the server again each time you use the command.

<summary>status</summary>
Allows you to edit the Status in the Tab List. <br>
It is highly recommended to use the UI for Status management as it provides way more features than the command. (accessible through lionAPI Main Menu or /status) 
You can set your own status, select a Global Status or use a dynamiv Status like your Teamname
